Server for signaling between webrtc peers.

Currently testing the stuff.

Target is only webrtc data and some kind of peer authentication hook on the server to be able to use it to establish connection in mydht application running over a webassembly webrtc transport (for a striple peer authentication could be checking of striple and its key derivation, plus if keyder collision resistance is not enough a peer authentication).
